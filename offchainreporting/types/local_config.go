	// Number of block confirmations to wait for before enacting an on-chain
	// configuration change. This value doesn't need to be very high (in
	// particular, it does not need to protect against malicious re-orgs).
	// Since configuration changes create some overhead, and mini-reorgs

	// Malicious re-orgs are not any more of concern here than they are in
	// blockchain applications in general: Since nodes check the contract for the
	// latest config every ContractConfigTrackerPollInterval.Seconds(), they will
	// come to a common view of the current config within any interval longer than
	// that, as long as the latest setConfig transaction in the longest chain is
	// stable. They will thus be able to continue reporting after the poll
	// interval, unless an adversary is able to repeatedly re-org the transaction
	// out during every poll interval, which would amount to the capability to
	// censor any transaction.

	// Polling interval at which ContractConfigTracker is queried for

	// if one doesn't exist. Recommended values are between two and five minutes.
